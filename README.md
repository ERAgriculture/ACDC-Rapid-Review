# ACDC-Rapid-Review


This repository hosts the code, data, and documentation for **“ACDC Practice Bundle Prioritization for Maize Beans and Coffee – Climate Resilience, Economic Performance and Water-Use Efficiency.”**  
The rapid review synthesises quantitative evidence on how **bundles of agro-ecological (AE) practices** affect:

* resilience to **drought, heat, and heavy rainfall/cyclones**
* **economic outcomes** – costs, revenues, profitability
* **water-use efficiency (WUE)** under drip and other irrigation systems
